# ISE444HW4
This code was a homework for ISE444 from Lehigh University, by Professor Katya Scheinberg

Neural Network Implementation with different solvers (SGD, SGD Momentum, ADAM)

This package is a complete implementation of 2 layer Neural Network without any use of Matlab NN toolbox. 
The code was used to classify MNIST dataset. 
Different solvers are implemented, SGD, SGD with Momentum and ADAM. 
Results can be compared using perfomance plots. 
Logistic Regression also is implemented for the sake of comparison with NN results. 

There is also a report of results that can be reviewed.
